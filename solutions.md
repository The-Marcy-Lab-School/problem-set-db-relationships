## Part 2: ERD Diagram
Create an Entity Relationship Diagram using [draw.io](https://draw.io). Include at least the following tables in your diagram and their relationships to each other.
* film
* actor
* category
* language

You must include all column names, but you do not have to list the data types next to your attributes (columns). You should place an asterisks next to the primary key of the entity. See an example below:

![ERD](./assets/erd_example.png)

> Note: There are some Many-to-Many relationships in here. Be sure to include the junction tables that link these relationships. For example, there is a M:M relationship between `film` and `actor`. This relationship is linked by the `film_actor` table. Be sure to include that in your ERD as well.
